<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
<p>
The package MSESS implements http server for single page application.
That is the package assumes that an <a href="#USER">USER</a> (an end user of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>) by mean of some program invoked
the index page (with the path "/") only and only once for duration their interaction with the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>). 
</p>
<p>
The central notion here is an <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a>, that is set of functionality which are provided with the index page
and through wich a <a href="#USER">USER</a> performs all business tasks for that the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a> is intended.
</p>
<p>
It is important to see that <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a> is not a program (for example, a browser) on some host
that the some person starts with perpose to do some business tasks. Through the program he runs the functionality
which is called agent.
</p>
<p>
An <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a> is a part of the -SYSTEM-. As such it cannot be arbitrary dispite theoretical ability to perform
some or all business tasks. That is the -AGENT- has been developed as a special part of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>
and <a href="#SERVER">Server</a> as the main part of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>
can check and checks that requests are come from a legal <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a>.
</p>
<p>
Each <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a> has a web socket connnection with <a href="#SERVER">Server</a>. Through it they exchange with
json messages of format <a href="#WSMESS">WSMESS</a>
</p>
<p>
This file determines terms (with their definitions) that describ features of the msess packet.
This assumes terms of "http server", "http client" in their common mean.

	<h3> DEFINITIONS </h3>
	<p id="USER">--USER<br>
		An USER is some person
    that have authority to perform some set of their business tasks into <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>.
    An USER interacts with SYSTEM through an <a href="#AGENT">AGENTs</a> and through only the AGENT.
    The first task that USER can perform into SYSTEM is proving his authority, that is login.
    His last task is announcement of end of his work, that is logout.<br>
    This last task causes destroying of the AGENT. That is an AGENT can serve only one USER.<b>
    Into the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>, a USER is identified by not negative integer, for example 0, 1, 2 ...  
	</p>
	<p id="SYSTEM">--SYSTEM<br>
		The SYSTEM is program device through which a <a href="#USER">USERs</a> cam perform some set of their business tasks. 
		The SYSTEM is unity of a http server (see <a href="#SERVER">SERVER</a>) and its special http clients called <a href="AGENT">AGENTs</a>.
	</p>
	<p id="SERVER">--SERVER<br>
		The SERVER is http server that was developed as the part of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>). It is the central part of the SYSTEM,
		that means that the SERVER is only unique part of the SYSTEM and can spawn another parts of the SYSTEM
    - <a href="#AGENT">AGENTs</a>. The server in common expect with each request a special encoded cookie. 
    If the cookie is decoded into right data the server takes the request as legal and perfprms it.
    Overwise the server answers with code 403. But there are requests that have not to deliver such cookie.
    They are so called out session requests and intercept requests. One of the last, with (relative) URL "/"
    is named <a href="#INDEX_REQUEST">INDEX REQUEST</a>. This request produces new agent
	</p> <!-- SERVER -->
	
	<p id="AGENT">--AGENT<br>
		An AGENT is a set of functionality and visial elements that realizes a special http client through which an user asks the SYSTEM
    to fulfil some task. That is an AGENT is a unity of a finite user interface and functions through which he can
    asks the system to do some action. In general, a finite user interacts with any system through some interface and functions,
    which this interface admitted to launch. An AGENT, in distinguish of that general case, must to give the server testimony
    that it was developed intentionally as a part of the system.<br>
    The server keeps the registry of agents in which an agent is represent by a record of next structure.<br>
    <pre>
    type Agent struct {
	RegTime time.Time //The moment of registration;

	RemoteAddress string //A remote address of a http client.
	UserAgent     string //A description of the http client.
  //Names last two fields are as names of correspondent headers of a http request.

	//The next two fields gives content of the agent's coocie
	Tag    string //a unique tag that identifies the agent
	UserId string //A <a href="#USER">USER</a> identifier.
  // "" means that no user currently enters the system
  //After assigning some value, it cannot be changed.

	conn  *websocket.Conn
	WsOut chan WsMess
}
    </pre>

  <p id="INDEX_REQUEST">--INDEX_REQUEST<br>
    An INDEX REQUEST is a request with reletive url "/". It is one of <a href="#INTECEPT_REQUESTS">INTECEPT_REQUESTS</a><br>
    It registers a new <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a>  without a <a href="#USER">USER</a> <br>
    It means that for admitting some <a href="#USER">USER</a> to <a href="#SYSTEM">the SYSTEM</a> it is reqiered a successful request of "/login".
  </p>

  <p id="WSMESS">--WSMESS<br>
    WSMESS stands for web socket message.
    It is a map[string]string, with which an <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a> and the <a href="#SERVER">Server</a>
    are exchanging information. This map must satisfies next requirements:
  <ol>
  <li>Keys are case sensitive.</li>
  <li>If there is the key "err" and its value is not empty
    it carries the error message and all other keys (if they are) deliver additional info to the err's value.
    Such WSMESS is called ERRWSMESS
    If its value is empty the key is ignored
  </li>
  <li>If there is not the key "err" or its value is empty must be keys "action", "From", and "To".</li>
  <li>The keys "from", and "to" carry addresses of from the message originates and where it destines.
    "user:iser_id" or "tag:tag_value". The last form means the message from an AGENT when no user is bound to them.<br>
    Values of these keys may be empty. In such cases the "from" means from the SERVER and the "to" means to all.
  </li>
  <li>The key "Action" carry a description of a want of a sender to do some deed by recipient.<br>
    It is assumed that WSMESS may meet some doer into chain of working that knows what to do with WSMESS with given action.
    See <a href="#WSCHAIN">WSCHAIN</a>
  </li>
  </ol>

  <p id="INTECEPT_REQUESTS">--INTECEPT_REQUESTS<br>
    INTECEPT_REQUESTS are those that are handled by the package itself. 
    That is the application programmer cannot able  to handle the requests : his codes will never be invoked.<br>
    Those are :
    <ol>
		<li> <a href="#INDEX_REQUEST">INDEX REQUEST</a> </li>
		<li> <a href="#LOGIN_REQUEST">LOGIN REQUEST</a> </li>
    </ol>
