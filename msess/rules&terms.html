<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
<p>
The packet msess realized http server for single page application.
That is the packet assumes that a <a href="#USER">USER</a> (a ultimate user of the <a href="#SYSTEM">    SYSTEM</a>) by mean of some program invoked
the index page (with the path "/") only and only once for duration their interaction with the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>). 
</p>
<p>
The central notion here is an -AGENT-, that is set of functionality which are provided with the index page and
through wich a USER performs all business tasks for that the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a> is intended.
</p>
<p>
It is important to see that -AGENT- is not a program (for example, a browser) on some host that the some person starts
with perpose to do some business tasks. Through the program he but runs the functionality
that was obtained with the index page.
</p>
<p>
An -AGENT- is a part of the -SYSTEM-. As such it cannot be arbitrary dispite theoretical ability to perform
some or all business tasks. That is the -AGENT- has been developed as a special part of the -SYSTEM- and -SERVER- as
the main part of the -SYSTEM- can check and checks that requests are come from a legal -AGENT-.
