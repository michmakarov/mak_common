<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
<p>
The packet msess realized http server for single page application.
That is the packet assumes that a <a href="#USER">USER</a> (a ultimate user of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>) by mean of some program invoked
the index page (with the path "/") only and only once for duration their interaction with the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>). 
</p>
<p>
The central notion here is an <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a>, that is set of functionality which are provided with the index page
and through wich a <a href="#USER">USER</a> performs all business tasks for that the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a> is intended.
</p>
<p>
It is important to see that <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a> is not a program (for example, a browser) on some host
that the some person starts
with perpose to do some business tasks. Through the program he but runs the functionality
that was obtained with the index page.
</p>
<p>
An -AGENT- is a part of the -SYSTEM-. As such it cannot be arbitrary dispite theoretical ability to perform
some or all business tasks. That is the -AGENT- has been developed as a special part of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>
and <a href="#SERVER">Server</a> as the main part of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>
can check and checks that requests are come from a legal <a href="#AGENT">AGENT</a>.
</p>
<p>
This file determines terms (with their definitions) that describ features of the msess packet.
This assumes terms of "http server", "http client" in their common mean.

	<h3> DEFINITIONS </h3>
	<p id="USER">--USER<br>
		An USER is some person
    that have authority to perform some set of their business tasks through <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>. 
	</p>
	<p id="SYSTEM">
		The SYSTEM is program device through which a <a href="#USER">USERs</a> cam perform some set of their business tasks. 
		The SYSTEM is unity of a http server (see <a href="#SERVER">SERVER</a>) and its special http clients called <a href="AGENT">AGENTs</a>.
	</p>
	<p id="SERVER">
		The SERVER is http server that was developed as the part of the <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>). It is the central part of the SYSTEM,
		that means that the SERVER is only unique part of the SYSTEM and can spawn another parts of the SYSTEM
    - <a href="#AGENT">AGENTs</a>. The server in common expect with each request a special encoded cookie. 
    If the cookie is decoded into right data the server takes the request as legal and perfprms it.
    Overwise the server answers with code 403. But there are requests that have not to deliver such cookie.
    They are so called out session requests and intercept requests. One of the last, with (relative) URL "/"
    is named <a href="#INDEX_REQUEST">INDEX REQUEST</a>. This request produces new agent
	</p>
	<p id="AGENT">
		An AGENT is a set of functionality and visial elements that realizes a special http client through which an user asks the SYSTEM
    to fulfil some task. That is an AGENT is a unity of a finite user interface and functions through which he can
    asks the system to do some action. In general, a finite user interacts with any system through some interface and functions,
    which this interface admitted to launch. An AGENT, in distinguish of that general case, must to give the server testimony
    that it was developed intentionally as a part of the system.<br>

  <p id="INDEX_REQUEST">
    An INDEX REQUEST is a request with reletive url "/". It is one of <a href="INTECEPT_REQUESTS">INTECEPT_REQUESTS</a>
