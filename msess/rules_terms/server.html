		The SERVER is http server that was developed as the part of the <a href="system.html">SYSTEM</a>). It is the central part of the SYSTEM,
		that means that the SERVER is only unique part of the SYSTEM and can spawn another parts of the SYSTEM
	    - <a href="agent.html">AGENTs</a>. The server in common expect with each request a special encoded cookie. 
	    If the cookie is decoded into right data the server takes the request as legal and perferms it.
	    Overwise the server answers with code 403. But there are requests that have not to deliver such cookie.
	    They are so called out session requests and intercept requests. One of the last, with (relative) URL "/"
	    is named <a href="#INDEX_REQUEST">INDEX REQUEST</a>. This request produces new agent
