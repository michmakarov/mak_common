 <p> The package, if it is using (see <a href="api.html">API</a>, func CreateHub), 
 creates http.Server and gives it the structure feeler (see type feeler struct in feeler.go).
 The structure has  func (f *feeler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) which receives all requests
 for preliminary working.
 A result of this working may be (case 1) generating the package's own response or (case 2) transmitting the request to <a href="programmer.html">PROGRAMMER</a>'s handler.
 That is through func CreateHub (its third parameter) a <a href="programmer.html">PROGRAMMER</a> must give a handler to which will be transmitting requests the responses to which
 have not been generated. Next the algorithm of sorting out the cases are describing.<br> 
 To obtain the precise algorithm see func (f *feeler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) in feeler.go file<br>
