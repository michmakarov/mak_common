Agent. The conception must be revisioned. So it is needed to remove maintain of it.
_______201203 07:30 UserLogging: it is obvious that it must be being done into file and without any conditions.
_______201203 14:45 It is not good that that log files not be placed into an arbitrary place.
_______201203 15:36 Writing to file is a async operation or not? In other words: Is any sense to write into log in a distinct goloutine as it is with the feeler log. I am talking about a user log: let it be while the simplest.

201209 08:32 Overworking of loginpost function
_______13:39 doHijackedRequest(w, r, cookData, c)  - should or not the func enter into an annalise of cookData.UserID?
_______14:16 I am going to overworking func logout(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, cookData sessCookieData, cln *sessClient) as loginpost function 
_______14:43 Now doHijackedRequest
_______16:38 index page (index.html)
Goal: it should be a SPA for, at least, the login and the logout.

201223 03:51 Yesterday: mending the feeler for hijack requests and agents.
And now!!! What is the outsession requests; how and when to handle them?
_______04:40 trying tgh.sh
_______05:30 the tgh.sh as if works properly for the moment.
_______18:55 Have the HIJACKED_REQUEST requests have the agent password. Obviously no.

201224 04:05 It is need to rethink and rewrite the type CheckUserCredentails and the request /login
_______04:58 How to intercept a fault of calling callback function?
As if in such action  in general there is little sense as a programer may have made there an infinite loop.
_______13:17 Nonsense! All callbacks must be invoked through envelope functions.
_______14:49
./tgh.sh "done: /login (func loginpost) and func checkUserCredentailsEnv"

201230 14:25 --CheckUserCredentails-- (see api.txt) For what is the "action" parameter need?
The old programmer truth: if you define thing you should explain for what it is needed. It may be that you have defined it because of a silly hurry.
When I have been creating the parameter a dim thought was being before me: how to register a new user! The fool gives birth to a foolishness!
For this is more better and simpler to expand the ksess and to to define a new hijaked request.

210101 07:56 It is from the rels, of cause. From there it arises that it is not enough info the front logging gives. But, in the same time, now reports of the front logging are bulky and cumbersome.
_______08:20 The idea is: to expand SessConfigParams.Debug with additional values to make capabilities of the front logging more flexible.
